/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Violet Bites.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles, orders, order items, and payments.
 * Menu items are publicly readable, but writable only by admins.
 * Admin dashboard data is only accessible to users with the 'admin' role.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /menu_items/{menuItemId}: Stores menu items.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}: Stores order information for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}/order_items/{orderItemId}: Stores individual order items for a specific order.
 * - /users/{userId}/payments/{paymentId}: Stores payment information for a specific user.
 * - /admin_dashboards/{dashboardId}: Stores admin dashboard data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed for non-admins.
 * - Menu items are publicly readable.
 * - All write operations (create, update, delete) are strictly controlled based on ownership or admin roles.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - User roles are stored directly in the /users/{userId} document to avoid costly `get()` calls.
